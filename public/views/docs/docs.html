			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<h3>How It works</h3>	

			<ol>
				<li>The Browser connects to the desired url which is in the form of http:/localhost:3000 (if you're in a development environment) or the site name.The Connection is handled by Express which usesthe consolidate.js library to render the server side application markup (the default templating engine is swig).
				</li>
				<li>Page is returned to browser - The page rendered contains the inclusion of the angular.js library(among others).
				The markup contains an "ng-view" tag which is where the angular app initializes.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Installation</h3>

			<p>To startup with MEAN follow the next step:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Use git to clone the repository</li>
			<li>Enter the subdirectory that was created: <pre><code>cd mean</code></pre>ยง</li>
			<li>Install MEAN.IO's dependencies by running:<pre><code> npm install</code></pre></li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			Standing on the Shoulders of giants....

			<h3>NPM</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="npm"></div>
			<p>npm is the official package manager for Node.js. As of Node.js version 0.6.3, npm is bundled and installed automatically with the environment. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. It also allows users to install Node.js applications that are available on the npm registry.</p>

			<h3>Bower</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="bower"></div>
			<p>Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.
			Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).</p>

			<h3>Grunt</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="grunt"></div>
			<p>Grunt is a great tool for automating you JavaScript tasks. The ecosystem is huge, containing many common tasks you can use in your daily development process.
			To configure grunt you start with the gruntfile.js file, where you define the tasks you want to run. 
			We start with two basic tasks:
			</p>
			

<h4>Default</h4>
<p>The default task is the task that runs when you type 'grunt' in your command-line, the default task consists of three sub-tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>JSHint:</strong> The linter task that keep your JavaScript code free of common mistakes and syntax errors.</li>
	<li><strong>Watch:</strong> This watches your file system for changes and automatically reloads the application whenever you change certain files.</li>
	<li><strong>Nodemon:</strong> This runs your Node.js application using nodemon.
		Please notice that the last two tasks are wrapped with another task called Concurrent to keep the application continuously running.
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Test</h4>
<p>This task runs when you type 'grunt test' in your command-line, the test task consists of three sub-tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>env:test :</strong> This is a simple task that changes the NODE_ENV global environment variable to 'test'.</li>

<li><strong>mochaTest:</strong> This runs the mocha server tests that are located in the app/tests folder.
</li>
<li><strong>karma:unit</strong></li> This uses the karma test runner to run the AngularJS unit tests.
